    "## 4.1 Files ##\n",
    "Files are logical units of information created by processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.1 File Naming ###\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.2 File Structure ###\n",
    "There are 3 common models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Byte Sequence####\n",
    "1. The operating system regards files as nothing more than byte sequences. It provides the maximum amount of flexibility. Users can put anything they want in thier files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. All versions of UNIX and Windows use this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Record Sequenc####\n",
    "1. A file is a sequence of fixed-length records, each with some internal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The central idea is that the read operation returns one record and the write operation overwrites or appends one record.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No current general-purpose system uses this model as its primary file system any more. But it was a common model on mainframe computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree ####\n",
    "1. A file consists of a tree of records, not necessarily all the same length, each containing a **key** field in a fixed position in the record. The tree is sorted on the key field, to allow rapid searching for a particular key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The basic operation is to get the record with a specific key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Used on some large mainframe computers for commercial data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.3 File Types ###\n",
    "1. Regular files: contain user information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Character speical files: related to input/output and used to model serial I/O devices, such as terminals, printers, and networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Block special files: sued to model disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Although technicially the file is just a sequence of bytes, the operating system will execute a file only if it has the proper format. It has five sections: header, text, data, relocation bits, and symbol table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.4 File Access ###\n",
    "1. Sequential access\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random-access \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Two methods for specifying where to start reading:\n",
    "    - `read` operation gives the position in teh file to start reading at\n",
    "    - `seek` operation sets the current position. After than, the file can be read sequentially from the now-current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.5 File Attributes ###\n",
    "1. A file's attributes, or metadata: other information associated with each file in operating systems, e.g. date and tiem the file was last modified, file size, protection, creator, key position, key length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.6 File Operations ###\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.7 An Example Program Using File-System Calls ###\n",
    "1. File descriptors: small integers returned when a file is opened.\n"

    "## 4.2 Directories ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.1 Single-Level Directory Systems ###\n",
    "1. One directory contains all files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Advantage: its simplicity and the ability to locate files quickly. Still be used on simple embedded devides such as digital cameras an some portable music players.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.2 Hierarchical Directory Stytems ###\n",
    "1. Nearly all modern file systems are organized in this manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.3 Path Names ###\n",
    "1. absolute path name vs. relative path name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.4 Directory Operations ###\n",
    "1. `link`, a technique that allows a file to appear in more than one directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `unlink`. In UNIX, the system call for deleting fiels is, in fact, `unlink`.\n"

    "## 4.3 File-System Implementations ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.1 File-System Layout ###\n",
    "1. File sytems are stored on disks. Most disks can be divided up into one or more partitions, with independent file systems on each partition. Sector 0 of the disk is called the ***MBR (Master Boot Record)***.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Disk partition: Boot block; superblock; free space mgmt; i-nodes; root dir; files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.2 Implementing Files ###\n",
    "#### Contiguous Allocation ####\n",
    "1. Store each file as a contiguous run of disk blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Advantages:\n",
    "    - Simple to implement.\n",
    "    - The read performance is execellent because the entire file can be read from the disk in a single operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Disadvantages:\n",
    "    - Over the course of time, the disk becomes fragmented.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linked-List Allocation ####\n",
    "1. Advantages:\n",
    "    - Sequantial access is straightfoward.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Disadvantages:\n",
    "    - Random access is slow\n",
    "    - Generates overhead (i.e. info like pointer words)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linked-List Allocation Using a Table in Memory ####\n",
    "1. Advantages:\n",
    "    - Reduces pointer words overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Disadvantages:\n",
    "    - The whole table must be in memory all the time to make it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I-nodes ####\n",
    "1. A.K.A index-node, which lists the attributes and disk addresses of thefile's blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Advantages:\n",
    "    - The i-node need be in memory only when the corresponding file is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.3 Implementing Directories ###\n",
    "1. Two options to store file attributes:\n",
    "    - Store fixed-size entries with the disk addresses and attributes in the directory entry.\n",
    "    - Each entry just refers to an i-node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two ways of handling long file names in a directory: \n",
    "    - In-line.\n",
    "    - In a heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.4 Shared Files ###\n",
    "1. Two ways to implement:\n",
    "    - Hard linking: disk blocks are not listed in directories, but in the i-node. The directories would then point just to the i-node. This approach is used in UNIX.\n",
    "    - Symbolic linking: B links to one of C's files by having hte system create a new file, of type LINK, and entering that file in B's directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Advantages and disadvantages of symbolic linking:\n",
    "    - Adv: The problem that C deletes a file B refering to and B's file pointing to a not existing does not arise because only the true owner has a pointer to the i-node. Users who have linked to the file jsut have path names, not i-node pointers.\n",
    "    -Adv: they can be used to link to files on machines anywhere in the world, by simply providing the network address of the machine where the file resides in addition to its path on that machine.\n",
    "    - Dis: extra overhead required.\n",
    "    - Dis: when links are allowed, files can have two ro more paths. Programs that start at a given directory and find all the files in that directory and tis subdirectories will locate a linked file multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.5 Log-Structured File Systems ###\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.6 Journaling File Systems ###\n",
    "1. Basic idea: Keep a log of what the file system is going to do before it does it (and remove the log AFTER it does it), so that if the system crashes before it can do its planned work, upon rebooting the system can look in the log to see what was going on all the time of the crash and finish the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To make journaling work, the logged operations must be ***idempotent***, which means they can be repeated to as often as necessary without harm.'\n",

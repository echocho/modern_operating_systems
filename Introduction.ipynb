    "## 1.6 System Calls ##\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any single-CPU computer can execute only one instruction at a time. If a process is running a user program in user mode and needs a program service, such as reading data from a file, it has to execute a trap instruction to transfer control to the operation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.61 System Calls for Process Management ###\n",
    "2. *Fork* is the only way to create a new process in POSIX. It creates an exact duplicate of the original process, incuding all the file descriptors, registers - everything. After the *fork*, the origianl process and the copy (the parent and child) go their separate ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The *fork* call returns a value, which is zero in the child and equal to the child's *PID* in the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `main(argc, argv, envp)` \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Processes in UNIX have their memory divided up into three segments: the *text segment* (i.e., the program code), the *data segment* (i.e., the variables), and the *stack segment*.\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "### 1.62 System Calls for File Management ###\n",
    "6. Most programs read and wirte fiels sequentially, but some need to be able to access any part of a file at random. Associated with each file is a pointer that indicates the current position in the file. When reading(writing) sequentially, it normally points to the next byte to be read (write).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. *lseeek* call changes the value of the position pointer, so that subsequent calls to read or write can begin anywhere in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In UNIX, *stat* call shows the file mode (regular file, special file, directory, and so on), size, time of last modification, and other information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.63 System Calls for Directory Management ###\n",
    "9. *mkdir*\n",
    "\n",
    "10. *rmdir*\n",
    "\n",
    "11. *link* call allows the same file to appear under two names, often in different directories. A common use case is sharing a file among team members (not like coping). Every file in UNIX has a unique number, its i-number, taht identifies it. This i-number is an index into a table of *i-nodes*, one per file, telling who owns the file, where its disk blocks are, etc. A directory is simply a file containing a set of (i-number, ASCII names) pairs. Command `link('usr/jim/memo', '/usr/ast/note')`, provided `'/usr/ast/note'` has i-number 90, creates a directory with a new file name `'usr/jim/memo'` which points to i-number 90.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. *mount* system call allows two file systems to be merged into one. A common use case: insert a USB disk with files to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellaneous System Class ###\n",
    "13. *chdir* calss is used to change the current working directory. On some systems, this command is used as an alias for the shell command*cd*\n",
    "\n",
    "14. *chmod*\n",
    "\n",
    "15. *kill* is the way users and user processes send signals. If a process is prepared to catch a particular signal, then when it arrives, a signal handler is run. If the process is not prepared to handle a signal, then its arrival kills the process. \n",

    "## 1.7 Operating System Structure ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7.1 Monolithic Systems ###\n",
    "1. The entire operating system runs as a single program in kernel mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The operating system is wirtten as a collection of procedures, linked together into a single alrge executable binary program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each procedure in the system is free to call any other one - it is efficient, and yet unwidely and difficult to understand too. In addition, a crash in any of these procedures will take down the entire operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Basic structure for a monolithic operating system:\n",
    "        a. A main program that invokes the requested service procedure\n",
    "        b. A set of service procedures that carry out the system calls\n",
    "        c. A set of utility procedures that help the service procedures\n",
    "        \n",
    "### 1.7.2 Layered Systems ###\n",
    "1. First layered system: THE system built by E. W. Dijkstra and his students.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structure:\n",
    "        Layer 5: The operator\n",
    "        Layer 4: User programs\n",
    "        Layer 3: Input/output management\n",
    "        Layer 2: Operator-process communication\n",
    "        Layer 1: Memory and dum management\n",

    "### 1.7.3 Microkernels ###\n",
    "1. Research found that in serious industrial systems, there is 2 to 10 bugs per thousand lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Basic idea behind the microkernel desing: to achieve high reliability by splitting the operating system up into small, well-defined modules, only one of which--the microkernel--runsin kernel mode and the rest run as relatively powerlessordinary user processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MINIX 3 ####\n",
    "1. Is only about 12,000 lines of C and some 1400 lines of assembler\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The C code manages and schedules processes, handles interprocess communication (by pasing messages between processes), and offers a set of about 40 kernel calss to allow the rest of the operating system to do its work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Structure:\n",
    "        **Layer 3: User programs** \n",
    "        **Layer 2: Servers** (do most of the work of the oeprating system)\n",
    "        **Layer 1: Drivers** (do not have physical access to the I/O port space; do not issue I/O commands directly; make kernel calls instead)\n",
    "        **Layer 0: Microkernel** (which handles interrupts, processes, scheduling, interprocess communication)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reincarnation server: whose job is to check if the other servers and drivers are functioning correctly. If a faulty one is detected, it is automatically replaced without any user intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. An idea related to having a minimal kernel is to put the **mechanism** for doing something in the kernel by not the **policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7.4 Client-Server Model ###\n",
    "1. Often the lowest layer is a microkernel, but that is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Communication between clients and servers is often by message passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7.5 Virtual Machines ###\n",
    "1. ***Batch operating systems***: Users of batch systems do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares his/job job on an off-line device and submits it to the computer operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Time-sharing operating systems***: Users located at various terminals can use a particular computer system at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The main difference between Multiprogrammed Batch Systems and Time-Sharing Systems is that in case of Multiprogrammed batch systems, the objective is to maximize processor use, whereas in Time-Sharing Systems, the objective is to minimize response time.\n",

    "## 2.1 Processes ##\n",
    "1. Process: an abstraction of a running program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pseudoparallelism v.s. multiprocessor \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In each CPU, there is always one process running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1 The Process Model ###\n",
    "1. In this model, all the runnable software on the computer, sometimes including the operating system, is organized into a number of ***sequential processes(processes)***.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A process is an instance of an executing program, including the current values of the program counter, registers, and variables. Conceptually, each process has its own virtual CPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Processes must not be programmed with built-in assumptions about timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Process v.s. program\n",
    "        - a ***process*** is an activity of some kind. It has a program, input, output, and a state.\n",
    "        - a single processor may be shared among several processes, with some scheduling algorithm being accustomed to determine when to stop work on one proces and service a different one.\n",
    "        - in contrast, a ***program*** is something that may be stored on disk, not doing anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 Process Creation ###\n",
    "1. Four principle events cause processes to e created:\n",
    "        - System initialization.\n",
    "        - Execution of a process-creation system call by a running process.\n",
    "        - A user request to create a new process.\n",
    "        - Initiaiton of a batch job.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. Deamons: processes that stey in the background to handle some activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Technically, in all cases, a new process is created by having an existing process execute a process creation system call.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `fork` in the only one system call to create a new process in UNIX. This call creates an exact clone fo the calling process. After that, the child process executes `execve` or a similar system call to change its memory image and run a new program.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In Windows, in contrast, s single Win32 function call, `CreateProcess`, handles both process creation and loading the correct program into the new process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In both UNIX and Windows systems, after a process is created, the parent and child have their own distinct address spaces. NO WRITABLE MEMORY IS SHARED.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3 Process Termination ###\n",
    "1. Conditions where new process will terminate:\n",
    "        - Normal exit (voluntary). E.g. the process has done its work\n",
    "        - Error exit (voluntary). E.g. the process discovers a fatal error\n",
    "        - Fatal error (involuntary). E.g. caused by the process, bugs\n",
    "        - Killed by another process (involuntary). E.g. (by system call `kill`)\n",
    "        \n",
    "### 2.1.4 Process Hierarchies ###\n",
    "1. In some systems, when a process creates another process, the parent process and child process continue to be associated in certain ways. The child process can itself create more processes, forming a process hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A process has only one parent but can have multiple chilren.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In UNIX, a process and all of its children and further descendants together form a process group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Unlike in Windows, process in UNIX cannot disinherit their children.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.5 Process States ###\n",
    "1. Three states a process may be in:\n",
    "        - Running (actually using the CPU at that instant).\n",
    "        - Ready (runnable; temporarily stopped to let another process run).\n",
    "        - Blocked (unable to run until some external event happends).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Four possible transitions among these three states:\n",
    "        - Process blocks for input.\n",
    "        - Scheduler picks another paroacess.\n",
    "        - Scheduler picks this process.\n",
    "        - Input becomes available.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The lowest layer of a process-structured operating system handles interrupts and scheuling. Above taht layer are sequential processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.6 Implementation of Processes ###\n",
    "1. The operating system maintains a table (an array of structures), called the **process table/process control blocks**. This entry contains import information abotu the process' state, i.e., its program counter, stack pointer, memory allocation, the status of its open files, its accouting and scheduling information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Associated with each I/O class is a location (typically at a fixed location near the bottom of memory) called the **interrupt vector**. It contains the address of the interrupt service procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.7 Modeling Multiprogramming ###\n",
    "1. Skeleton of what the lowest level of the operating system does when an interrupt occurs:\n",
    "        a. Hadware stacks program counter, etc.\n",
    "        b. Hardware loads new program counter from interrupt vector.\n",
    "        c. Assembly-language procedure saves registers.\n",
    "        d. Assembly-language procedure sets up new stack.\n",
    "        e. C interrupt service runs (typically reads and buffers input)\n",
    "        f. Scheduler decides which process is to run next.\n",
    "        g. C procedure returns to the assembly code.\n",
    "        h. Assembly-language procedure starts up new current process.\n",
    "        \n",

    "## 2.2 Threads ##\n",
    "In traditional operating systems, each process has an address space and a single ghread of control. In fact, thatis almost the definition of a process. Nevertheless, in many situations, it is desirable to have multiple threads of control in the same address space running in quasi-parallel, as though they were (almost) separate processes (except for the shared address space).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 Thread Usage ###\n",
    "1. Threads: miniprocesses running in a process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reasons to have threads:\n",
    "        - In many aplications, multiple activities are going on at once. Some of these may block from time to time.\n",
    "        - Threads have the ability for the parallel entities to share an address space and all of its data among themselves.\n",
    "        - Threads are lighter weight than processes, thus they are easier (i.e., faster) to create and destroy.\n",
    "        - Threads yield no performance gain when all of them are CPU bound, but when there is substantial computing and also substantial I/O, having threads allows these activities to overlap, thus speeding up the application.\n",
    "        - Threads are useful on systems with multiple CPUs, where real parallelism is possible.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Example: Word processors: one thread listening to user input, one thread reformatting files, and one backup the whole file periodically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finite-state machine: each computation has a saved state, and there exists some set or events that can occur to change the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Three ways to construct a server:\n",
    "        **Model**                  **Characteristics**\n",
    "        Threads                     Parallelism, blocking system calls\n",
    "        Single-threaded process     No parallelism, blocking system calls\n",
    "        Finite-state machine        Parallelism, nonblocking system calls, interrupts\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Example: an application that processes very large amounts of data. One input thread, one processing thread, one output thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 The Classical Tread Model ###\n",
    "1. The process model is based on two independent concepts: resource grouping and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One way of looking at a process is that it is a way to group related resources together. A process has an address space containing program text and data, as well as other resources. These resources may include open files, child processes, pending alarms, signal handlers, accouting information, and more. By putting them together in the form of a process, they can be managed more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The other concept a process has is a thread of execution. Process are used to group resources together, threads are the entities scheduled for execution on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What treads add to the process model is to allow multiple executions to take place in the same process enviroment, to a large degree independent of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When a multithreaded process is run on a single-CPU system, the threads take turns running.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Items shared by all threads in a process and items private to each thread:\n",
    "        **Per-process items**            **Per-thread items**\n",
    "        Address space                    Program counter\n",
    "        Global variables                 Registers\n",
    "        Open files                       Stack\n",
    "        Child processes                  State\n",
    "        Pending alarms\n",
    "        Signals and signal handlers\n",
    "        Accouting information\n",
    "        \n",
    "7. States of a thread: running; blocked; ready; terminated\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `thread_create`. When multithreading is present, processes usually start with a single thread present. This ghread ha sthe ability to create new threads by calling this library procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `thread_exit`. When a tread finishes its work.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `thread_join`. One thread can wait for a (specific) thread to exit by calling this procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `thread_yield`. Allows a thread to voluntarily give up the CPU to let another thread run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3 POSIX Threads ###\n",
    "1. Pthreads: To make it possible to write portable threaded programs, IEEE has defined a standard to threads in IEEE standard 1003.1c. The threads package it defines is called **Pthreads**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.4 Implementing Threads in User Space ###\n",
    "1. Advantages: \n",
    "        - A user-level threads package can be implemented on an operating system that does not support threads.\n",
    "        - They allow each process to have its own customized scheduling algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When threads are managed in user space, each process needs it own private **thread table** to keep track of the threads in that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the program calls or jumps to an instruction that is not in memory, a **page fault** occurs and the operating system will go and get the missing instruction (and its neighbors) from disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Disavantages:\n",
    "        - The problem of hwo blocking system calls are implemented.\n",
    "        - If a thread starts runing, no other thread in that process will ever run unless the first thread voluntarily gives up the CPU.\n",
    "        - Programmers generally want threads precisely in application where the threads block often, as, for example, in a multithreaded Web server.\n",
